# Notes
My guides, stories and autobiography

Since my autobigraphy is in Croatian, here is a quick rundown of my life, in English:

My name is Goran Štambuk. I was born in Yugoslavia, Croatia, Dalmatia, Zadar on 2nd June 1979, 1:30am.
At the age of 4, a neighbour asked me to try drinking a yoghurt. I took a little sip, but didn't like the taste so I returned it.
The boy next to me drank it bottoms up, and the neighbour asked him if he wanted to come play at his apartment. The chubby kid agreed.
I asked if I could come play too, and he said not now, come at 2pm. I came, but nobody opened the door, and I left, but with a pain at my behind.
I become strange after that. I ask another kid, male, to get naked, and I lay naked on him, but not knowing what I should be doing.
He suggest I should find a girl, and I do, but she runs away after I propose she comes into a made up hole in the bush with cardboard on the floor.
I also hum song Offenbach - Katchi, 40y before it is released, in english that I still didn't learn a word of.

I'm being bullied since first day of elementary school, and I sit with a Rom, who everyone is calling gypsy.
I call him gipsy too, not knowing that's an insult and he takes me to his dad, but I don't remember what happened there, only that I had a sore ass when I left, and that a slim young guy only I could see asked me what happened.
We go on a train trip with class, someone says Tito is in an armored wagon, and us kids climb to locomotive and find nobody there.
I pull some lever, other kids do some other mess, then I get 2nd thought and return the lever, but Marko Šarin pulls it back.
We go back to last wagon, where I peek out and see train falling off a bridge in the distance. We all jump out of the train, and that slim young guy appears again, but other kids tell him it was all my fault.

Back at where my parents and me lived, a bunch of people goes into something resembling a celler in a yard in Stadionska cesta. I close the door after they all went in and tell my dad what I did, and he said he went there and locked the door.

War started in Yugoslavia when my country, Croatia, seperated, and my dad, Željko loses his job, because he was working for a Serbian company, and we relied on mom, who was Serbian and worked in cadastre. 
My 2nd floor neighbour, Dalibor Podrug, gives me a Motorola, and I mention action Maslenica on it, not knowing I shouldn't mention that. I likely tipped off the Serbs, and a lot more people died then should because of my stupidity.
One autumn, we figured out we will stay out of firewood for the winter, so my dad decides to go into Serb occupied teritory for wood, with his Borba truck, and takes me with him.
Cetnicks stop us, and one of them asks me if I know who he was. I said, I know, you're cetnik! He got pissed off and told me and dad to get out of the truck. They took my dad behind the truck,
and one of them told me to turn around and concluded I have a nice little head. Next thing I know, we're sitting at Borba truck again, and he asks me again if I knew who he was, but this time
I say I don't, so they let us go. Dad tells me to stay in the truck while he loaded the firewood, and there were no cetniks on the way back. My dad found his truck torched to the ground one morning.

I play with some kid on rooftop of a building, and the apartment below catches fire. A guy shows up, ties a rope, tells us not to touch it, and goes down to rescue people from the window, but the rope
unties. The kid tells me not to look what happened, but I think everyone thought I untied the rope (which I didn't).

War ends, Croatia wins their independance, but since all kids except me were begging for grades on account of war, I'm unable to get into highschool I want, and I end up in Chemistry school.
I fall inlove with Ana, class president, who I write stupid love songs too and emberass myself in the process. Tina Opacic wants to be with me, but she looks almost exactly like my mom, and
I'm not interested, while Ana Biloglav isn't interested in me.

I get my first PC during highschool, my mom worked entire summer extra to be able to afford it to me, and I skip classes to go home play Dune 2. I almost fail the year because of sheer number of
skipped classes. 

Dad got a job at Slobodna Dalmacija as a driver, similar to his job at Borba, and he brings me Bug magazines, PC World, Byte, comic books to read. I overclock my Pentium 120 Mhz via jumpers to 133 MHz thanks to guide in Bug.
My elementary school buddy, Domagoj Škifić, who I bored to tears by wanting to play at his PC before I got mine, infects me with my first virus. I meet a hacker called Nikola Prtenjača, who is showing me code obfuscation.

While I go swimming one summer, on my way back I went to buy ice cream at area of my hometown called Relja, and I call the seller šiptar, not knowing it's an insult. I leave with a sore ass, not remembering what happened.

I also exibit wish to sing, so mom sends me to a mentor of some sort, but he insults me. On the way back, my behind is sore again.

I go with Antun Stamać and Filip Fiala on Info 96, an IT fair in Zagreb. I end up with a tissue placed on my nose in OS/2 Warp simulator with all 3 of us inside. I don't remember neither what nor why it happened.

When I turned 18, my mom paid for my drivers licence and I got a job at Croit, who sold toys. I went with company Fiat Fiorino to pick up my drivers licence. I work all day at Croit, and mom forces me to go prepare for college at 
a nearby professors house, but I usually fall asleep tired during lessons.

When I got my first sallary, me and a friend Andrej Juričin go for a drink where we meet 2 girls, Tina and Slavica. He ends up with Tina and me with Slavica and we go on concert of the Beat Fleet presenting their Ping Pong album at Baracuda beach bar.
A week later, Slavica comes over to my apartment, and ends up accusing me of raping her, which I don't understand, since there was no rape. We stay in relationship another month and a half, then she says she needs to go to some guy if he calls her,
and I dump her.

Mom pulls some connections and I enroll Geodesy in Zagreb. My room mates are Žan Glavan, a buddy from elementary school and Filip Fiala, who talks me into trying out gay sex. I never allowed him to nail me, and I couldn't get a hard on on a guy, but I wake up
with foggy mind and a sore ass. For some reason, I can't figure out what happened. I end up sleeping with Sandra, Ana Biloglav room mate, who later turned out to be a stripper. Ana also wants to sleep with me, but she has a bf, 
and I don't wanna do that to some guy. I also get assaulted by 2 tall guys with knives while I'm dating a girl, but I run away like a coward and never find out what happened to my date. 
I end up in relationship with Ivana Brusar, who mentions I'm from Zadar in underpass while there were some baddies there who follow me on my return, but some cops show up. Anyway I quit on college after 7 months "studying", and go back to Zadar and break up with Ivana.

In Zadar I meet Jadranka Bistričić, whome I deflower first weekend after oath in the army, but I end up raped multiple times in the army, and Jadranka ends up sleeping with everyone I knew.

Dad buys a red Kia Pride while I'm in the army. I drive to new years eve to Sukosan, where I make a son to a girl called Albina Hrnčević, but she is only 16 and doesn't want to raise the kid with me. 
I'm actually not even aware she was left pregnant. A weird thing happens there, I go through a stone arcade passage and all the people in the village and people at the house disappear.

I get a job at Tisak, as a driver and meet Branka, a single mom with a 4yo son, and I make her pregnant, then she aborts, then we break up. I see her years later when she came to Tankerkomerc Marina for one hour to yacht with two Italian dudes on.

I meet a guy called Marko Grbić, whome I spend time smoking pot with until he rapes me, hits some kid while I let him drive my dads car, and also gives me Trip, a drug.

I get a job at hearing aids company, but I endure some kind of strange attack there on my psyche involving company pc and phone line, after which I end up ratting on Andrejs dad, who ends up in prison, and me fired.

Andrej drives me to Zemunik, some kind of mental institution, but I don't remember 1 sec of my time spent there.

I'm fine for a while after treatment in zemunik, but get shizoaffective personality disorder a year or two later and parents take me to hospital.

I get schizofrenia meds but my devices are getting hacked for the next 20+ years, what I report to cops 13y later who seem to beat up Andrej, but to no effect.

I'm working mostly as a security guard and as a cab driver for a short while. I learn cybersec by googling to protect myself, and change roughly 20 gf's and 20 computers.

Andrej is gifting me $10 coupon for cex.io so I can mine crypto. I buy hashing power and proceed to mine crypto for the next 15y.

It seems some kind of command word is in my subconsciousness which makes me submissive and not remembering what happened while under that spell.

I meet 2 girls, Sandra Dragutin and Antonija Čurković, in Sandra I fall inlove with, but she ends up using that word on me and raping me while Antonia attempts the same, but I think unsuccesfully.

On Iskrica, I meet a girl called Mira Čačić. She buys me a husky and I move to Zagreb to live with her. We break up 7 months later after I suspect she tried to stay pregnant with someone else. Later on it ocurred to me Sandra told her how she can hypno me if she wants a baby.

I return to Zadar but my dad also turns against me and ends up sleeping with Jadranka. I also suspect someone paid him to replace my dog with almost identical one. This new dog isn't healthy and doesn't like me.

I meet a very ugly girl called Paula or Paola but she only wants to stay pregnant so I dump her without ever caming inside her.

Filip is tricking me into marrying some girl. I fail to see the bride face because of veo, and I think I'm just a witness. To this day I still don't know if wedding went through and if I'm married or not.

A waiter from Downtown bar, Ante Mitrović, wants me to nail his wife, Iva Delija, because he can't have kids. I refuse, but lose memory and see them having 2 kids on facebook, years later.

While I'm guarding Tankerkomerc marina, an elderly guy brags he nailed my mom while they were both at spa. 

My memories slowly start returning, bit by bit, at age of 35 I finally grasp figurative speech, as I understood everything literally till then.

When I go to irish pub, I sit at table with a dozen people, one of them asks what we think about gays, and I lose memory, then come back, and one of them is tossing me a knife to deal with the gay, but I don't remember what the gay did.

My friends Davor Baštanić and Ivica Stručić want me to drive them to Split, to parachuters club, where I end up raped.

I go to drink in UB40 place called Garden, where a guy approaches me and asks what I think about gays. He disappears before my eyes and I have 100kn missing in my wallet and a sore ass.

I meet a girl called Marina Šećer, and take her to a small island in area of Zadar called Arbanasi, but some guy there asks me what I think about gays, and I lose memory and Marina wants to leave.

My mom and my dog die, and I get family pension as 100% work unable, 70% off of my moms pension.

I hear Jadranka has a daughter too, but I think the child is either my dads, or my 2nd floor neighbours. If it's mine, then it's possible I have 4 kids I'm just biological father of.

Filip invites me to some pizzeria, and I come, only to suddenly find myself out of pizzeria. I go back in, Filip orders lasagne for him and his 2 buddies and pretends I don't exist, 
and one of the guests tells me one of the guests wanted a blowjob and paid Filip 100 eur to invite me there.

Someone seems to be breaking or pulling out my teeth from time to time, and one I day I couldn't stand up because my left knee was somehow broken. I limped for 2y after that and now I still have clicking sound but can walk normally.

I give my dad half my pension, 100 eur for bills and 50 eur for tobacco and I buy everything else I need for myself, like clothes and food, but my shirts, like 6 of them seem to be missing. It also seems someone is stealing tobacco and 
coffee capsules, and sometimes food I buy. I live with my dad in fear of ending up handicapped and raped because I can't afford a place of my own. I seem to constantly have a black eye but don't remember who punched me.

I end up repaying bank debt for years, then accidentally find out I already repaid it, but ended up a year longer paying it, since nobody gave me the papers I needed. I end up refunded, and buy a 4k tv and a new pc with the money I got back.

My dad seems to be taking money city of zadar was giving to me for firewood and easter, and buys me a bag of potato chips each time he makes a profit at my expense, as some sort of reward without telling me he got my money. 
He starts abusing me in every legal way possible, does little mischief to me what he can, but accuses me of doing that to him, and tells everyone how bad of a son I am. I conclude he is psycho and email the cops who send 2 cops over but
decide not to arrest my dad. Dad calls the cops on me too, because I opened front door to see who was in front with a knife in my hand, and I end up taken to hospital where I explain, 100% calm, what happened, but psychiatrist concludes
I'm agressive because I had a knife when I opened my door and I end up hospitalized for a month.

Internet isn't a nice place for me. It seems all the people that raped me, literally or figuratively, plus Andrej, plus my ex gfs are spreading a narrative I'm rapist, pedo, terorrist, everything disgusting possible. And they're using the word
to make me or trick me into confirming what they're saying. 

Sometimes I feel a sting in my behind, as if I took a needle, and I end up bleeding from my behind a day later.

Sometimes I get the shakes as if I'm suffering some drug withdrawal.

I got email from cex.io saying they will no longer do mining for customers, so I make a crypto wallet out of usb, transfer money to it, but that usb disappears and reapears 15 min later formatted. There was some BTC and at least 13 eth on it.
