Your brain may experience trauma. Usually trauma is connected with other, bad people, that did something to you you didn't want.
The result of this trauma may be mild, or it may cause something clinical. If it's clinical, you need meds.
Meds purpose is to set your brain chemistry balance to resting mode, so your brain can rest and recover by itself over time.
There is no other way of fixing a persons brain. This is also why usually coffee isn't recommended, as it sets your brain on high alert.

For example, if you develop schizophrenia, you should be given antipsychotics. If you develop depression, you should be given antidepressants. 
If you have manic depression, you should be given a med which is half antipsychotic, half antidepresant.
Rispolept is an example of antipsychotic, Zoloft is example of antidepressant and Zyprexa is example of combo of both.

Now, meds have sideeffects. And not all meds are based on same thing, so if they don't make you feel good, you should ask your psychatrist
to give you meds based on something else. You don't want to kill your loved ones, or experience hallucinations that bugs are attacking you
because of meds sideeffects.

If you are agressive, you may be hypnoed and a word put into your brain that calms you down and makes you submissive. This is so you don't
hurt anyone when you get an episode. Your parents or siblings simply say the word, and you shut down. However if word gets out, 
you may experience additional trauma by bad people. Athletes usually hypno themselves, to be better at sports, but when you are under hypnosis, 
your brain doesn't understand anything figurative, and takes everything literally. This is why Tyson bit Hollyfield, or Neymar bit other football player. 
Hypnosis is applied everywhere, ads, commercials, your fav mmo trying to reduce load on it's server by getting rid of not paying customers, etc...
