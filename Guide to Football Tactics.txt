1. Set mentality depending on number of defenders (CB, FB, SW, DM, WB)

a) 3 defenders = attacking
b) 4 defenders = control
c) 5 defenders = standard
d) 6 defenders = counter
e) 7 defenders = defensive

2. Set fluidity on depending on horizontal lines missing in formation (don't forget SW):

a) 0 lines missing = highly structured
b) 1 line missing = structured
c) 2 lines missing = flexible
d) 3 lines missing = fluid
e) 4 lines missing = very fluid

3. Fluidity meaning:

a) highly structured = players play assigned roles
b) structured = players play assigned roles and duties
c) flexible = players play assigned duties, but can bypass role
d) fluid = players can bypass role and duty
e) very fluid = players can bypass role and duty and mentality

4. Set support duties depending on fluidity (lower figure if 3 CB's)

a) highly structured = 0-1 support duties
b) structured = 2-3 support duties
c) flexible = 4-5 support duties
d) fluid = 6-7 support duties
e) very fluid = 8-9 support duties

5. Changing fluidity and mentality is needed to make a specific part of the pitch your strong spot.
However, the opposite will be your weak spot. This is useful if you want a group of players or a single player to excel for selling:

a) very fluid = right
b) fluid = central right
c) flexible = centre
d) structured = central left
e) highly structured = left

a) overload = GK
b) attacking = SW
c) control = CB
d) standard = DM
e) counter = MC
f) defensive = AMC
g) contain = ST

6) Notes

a) More fluid and more agressive will yield better results, but if mentality is higher than fluidity, players will get cards or get injured.
b) More fluid and more agressive will tire out players before match is over. You should switch to defense at end of match and replace most tired players at around 60th min.
c) Attacking mentality is played at high tempo, meaning players don't dwell on the ball, but instead pass immediatelly. 
The only way to score is by stretching opposition to create space. Defending in more agressive mentalities is done by starting on the ball earlier. 
d) Defensive mentality is played so you nick the ball, or start at attacker at last possible moment, and initiate counter. You run with ball till you are in front of their goal. 
If counter fails, you contain posession in front of their goal. Part of defensive mentality is keeping ball away from your goal.
e) So, ideally, you wanna play 4411 flexible control
