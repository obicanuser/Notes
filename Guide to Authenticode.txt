Windows authenticode basically serves as an antivirus. Authenticode key is this:

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\safer\CodeIdentifiers]
"AuthenticodeEnabled"=dword:00000000

Possible values of above registry key are as follows:

; 0x00040000: disallowed
; 0x00020000: untrusted
; 0x00010000: constrained (alias restricted)
; 0x00001000: normal user (alias basic user)
; 0x00000300: audit
; 0x00000000: fully trusted (alias unrestricted)

So, you might not want to alter the key to 40k, as that will restrict all untrusted software from running.
Basically, only signed, trusted, apps with good confidence will run in that case. Setting it to 10k value
may just block fishy executables and scripts.
