If you're wondering how hackers get in, there are 3 ways. 

First is if you leaked your IP, they connect to RDP port 3389, enter username and password when prompted or exploit missconfigured/unpatched RDP service.
2nd way is scanning your ports to find out whats listening, then exploiting something unpatched or maybe connecting to one of open shares.
3rd way is by making you download and execute malware, by a masked link or infected email, which will then use something builtin to phone home, like powershell.

Protection is pretty easy. You should download and install Simplewall from github, enable filters, drop whatever you were doing, and wait for firewall prompts.
If something like powershell makes a connection with all your softwares closed, make a user rule to block that ip. It can have multiple ways of phoning home, so stay patient for at least an hour.
That solves phoning home. To resolve incoming rdp, you should block incoming connections to local port 3389, which is rdp port.
To resolve hackers accessing your shares, you need to block incoming connections to samba, or smb for short, on local port 445.

Regarding what exactly phoned home, I suggest enabling logs in simplewall, then find out what called powershell to phone home and delete it.

Another thing hackers can connect to, is port 22, which is ssh. Another thing is telnet, which is port 23. Another thing is ftp, on ports 20-21

You also may want to deny connections to ports 135-139

To find out everything thats listening for connections and is a potential danger, open cmd or powershell or terminal and type in netstat -ano
If you aren't using whats listening for connections, feel free to add their port to block rule. You may want to use Simplewall by Henrypp,
because it configures base filtering engine, not firewall. Windows firewall auto allows rules which are more unique then others, so your
block rule may be overriden. Therefore, windows firewall is not safe.
