# Math

base weapon dmg * weapon power * +dmg(cat1) * +bonus dmg(cat2) * haste(cat3) * attack upgrade/weapon mods(final multipliers) -target resists = resulting dmg

# Important

Some stuff is for veterans, and lowest vet tier unlocks at 100 days. Type "/played" into chat window.

# How to play

Use both mouse buttons pressed at same time to pilot your ship. If you use cannons, stop at 9km from target and shoot. If you use beam arrays,
fly around non stop, preferably directly below or above targets. If you have low turn rate, try to keep engines at half speed.
Pve is mostly about dmg and to multiple targets, while Pvp is about dmg to single target. Both require tanking tho pvp doesn't require much dps.

# Tips

If you get shot at, placate the attacker. 

Move as fast as you can by triggering your fortified engines with aux to sif, your conn officer from phoenix, epte and evasive maneouvers.

Without subnuke, you will always be subpar in pvp.

Try to extend uptime and reduce cd of your attack upgrade, it is essential for high dps required for elite content.

Try not to double up on boff powers, or use two different attack patterns. 

Google each boff power on stowiki, and if it puts other skills on cd, don't use those other skills.

Haste is very much important

Sometimes only diff between you doing 100k dps and someone doing 300k is their max hit so crits (even from pets) are very much important.

High defense value will result with reduced dmg taken. Tho bonus accuracv is useless. Bonnus Accuracy is only needed in pvp, since everyone has increased defense value.

Get all reps maxed out even if you don't need the gear. They will appear in your passives and you may need the traits, ship modules and respecs.

Do all of R&D by doing 20h tasks. At level 15, they will give you nice traits and you'll be able to craft nice stuff.

Under Control space options, select maintain auto attack and enable never target pets and objects and aoe asisst. All other options off.

You can enable autofire on your hangar and your weps by right clicking on them, but do so in order which weapon recharges fastest is enabled first.

You will need to aquire ships for stuff they have, not to fly them. Pick ship you like and stay with it, just get other ships stuff for use on your own ship.

Do not rely on 2.5% proc chance anything. 

Always go for stuff that is per hit. 

Google everything and look if it's per cycle or per hit, or for a time period.

Regarding uptime, it would be a good idea to rely on stuff that has high uptime, provided it does decent dmg during it's uptime.

Try to login for at least 15 mins a day, if nothing else, just to do events, preferably an hour to do your daily missions too.

Advanced consoles you can only slot 1 type of, so slot ones your ship has most of.

Uni console slot can slot any type of console so get your 3 experimental upgrades to get to x2.

If you buy cstore version of a fleet ship, you can get fleet version for only 1 module and each rep you finish will reward you 1 module.

It is terribly important to debuff your enemy resists. And since it's hard to get resists much over 50%, and shields will prevent 90% dmg to hull,
I suggest you use attack pattern beta. Shield resists you can't debuff, shpen will actually increase bleedthrough to hull. 

You want to kill your target as fast as possible, so any dmg that bypasses shields is good. Lorca console may be of use too.

You are also advised to use dirty tricks. For example carrier wave shield hacking trait will drop shields for 5 sec on execution of any Intel ability.
Well guess what, theres an Intel ability called subspace beacon with 5sec cd.

Regarding cptn space skills, you need to calc how much does each of the 3 slots give you. Even if it sounds logical to put 3 points into shpen,
I advise against it, since the gain is small. Always look for what gives most where, then stack it there. 
For example, ships weapons are ideal for crtd or dmg mods.

# Space Keybinds

Copy the following in notepad and save as `Space.txt`. Then while you are in space in STO, type 

```
/unbind_all
```

and then 

```
/bind_load_file D:\Space.txt
```

(or the path where you saved the file). 

Assign your powers to tray 10, 9, 8 and 7 and keep pressing spacebar during combat. Turn off autofire on all your weps by right clicking on their icon in space to remove green square.

```

# Ground keybinds

Copy the following in notepad and save as Ground.txt. Then while you are on ground in STO, type 

```
/unbind_all
```

and then 

```
/bind_load_file D:\Ground.txt
```

(or path where you saved the file). 
Assign your abilities to tray 2 and 3, make sure basic weapon fire is in default location (tray 1 slot 1) and keep pressing key 1 during combat. 
Space is for jump and both mouse buttons for sprint.
