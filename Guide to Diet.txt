You need to understand some basics:

1) Aminoacids = short term, fast energy (bakery stuff)
2) Proteins = chains of aminoacids, long term energy (usually meat)
3) Vitamins = differences in foods, you or your pets will go blind and deaf without them (fruit, vegetables, spices, almost any food)
4) Fiber = good for your digestion system (chard)
5) Fat = has it's use, but for good looks you want to keep it low (margarin, cakes)
6) Calories = basically the strength of any food

How to lose weight:

If you eat rarely or too much, your body will learn energy isn't constant or is excesive and will stockpile it, meaning you wont look good.
If you do caloric deficit, meaning you only eat a bite or two, 5-6 times a day, you will teach your body energy is regular and constant and it will release surplus by itself, meaning you will look great.
It takes up to a year to teach your body. If you don't want to feel hungry, have protein rich diet, but to lose weight, ammount must be small. Vitamins will make sure you don't get sick.

Conclusion:

Your teeth are that of omnivore, and so is your digestive system. Meaning you need to eat different foods, meaning you need different vitamins to stay healthy.
Do not feed a carnivore, such as your dog, vegetables. If you don't want to feel hungry, eat protein rich food such as meat.
